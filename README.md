# 📚 Book Register

**Book Register** is a small project built in just **1 hour of vibe coding during art class** while I was bored.  
The project’s foundation was created with **ChatGPT**, and then expanded with **GenAI/Gemini** to handle most of the **frontend code**.  

I also contributed by sharing my **execution plan** with ChatGPT and guiding the structure of the project.

## ✨ Purpose

The goal of this project is to help organize a **personal library**.  
It works by using the **ISBN code** of each book and sending the data to a connected **Google Sheets document**, making it simple to track and manage book collections.

## 🚀 Tools & Contributions

- **ChatGPT** → Base logic and structure  
- **GenAI / Gemini** → Frontend and additional code  
- **Me** → Planning, execution outline, and integration ideas

## ⚠️ Important Note

Please **do not**:  
- Try to send random book entries into the website.  
- Inspect or mess with the push form code to send data into my Google Sheets.  

👉 The project is still unfinished, and I would hate having random/incorrect data inserted before it’s ready.

## 📖 Why?

Because sometimes the best ideas are born when you’re bored in class — and this project is proof of that!
